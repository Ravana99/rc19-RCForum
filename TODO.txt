• Tiny verifications in server (e.g. number of digits in field size <= 10)

• Timeout for UDP requests - no idea how to do, ask teacher Thursday

Not planning on doing this for the server (too time-consuming, not really worth it) but we should still make sure the user downloads files with question_get with this format:

• "Answers are identified by the question title concatenated with an underscore and a 2-digit number, assigned sequentially. A FS server will not accept more than 99 topics."

• "The questions received for each topic are stored by the FS in the corresponding folder, using a file named with the question title and extension “.txt”. If the question is accompanied by an image, the image is also stored with the same name and the original file extension (different from “.txt”). When the FS server starts, the questions and answers already available in the respective directories will be available for consultation by the users."
